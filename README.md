### 🌳 Development Workflow (Gitflow)

We use a structured gitflow strategy for organized development:

**Branch Structure:**

- `main` - Production-ready code (protected)
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features (`feature/user-authentication`)
- `release/*` - Release preparation (`release/v1.2.0`)
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes (`hotfix/critical-bug`)

**Getting Started:**

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes, test, commit
# Then create PR: feature/your-feature → develop
```

📖 **Read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed workflow instructions.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native 0.76.9 with Expo 52
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Database**: Expo SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build System**: EAS Build (Expo Application Services)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated builds

### 🏗️ App Architecture

The app follows a modern **file-based routing** architecture using Expo Router, with a clean separation of concerns:

```
app/
├── _layout.tsx                    # 🌍 Root layout (global setup, database initialization)
├── +native-intent.tsx            # 🔗 Deep linking & file import handler
├── error-handling.tsx            # ❌ Global error handling page
├── +not-found.tsx               # 🚫 404 fallback page
├── story/                       # 📖 Standalone story routes (deep linking)
│   └── [storyNumber]/
│       └── [frameNumber].tsx    # Direct story access via URLs
└── (tabs)/                      # 📱 Main app navigation
    ├── _layout.tsx              # Tab bar configuration
    ├── favorites.tsx            # ❤️ Favorites management
    ├── search.tsx              # 🔍 Content search
    └── (read)/                  # 📚 Reading interface
        ├── index.tsx            # 🏠 Library home/collections view
        ├── downloads/           # 📥 Content management
        │   ├── index.tsx        # 🌍 Language selection
        │   └── [language].tsx   # 📦 Collections by language
        ├── stories/             # 📋 Story browser
        │   └── index.tsx        # Story list for collection
        └── story/               # 📖 Story reading modes
            └── [collectionId]/
                └── [storyNumber]/
                    ├── [frameNumber].tsx  # 📄 Frame-by-frame reading
                    └── vertical.tsx       # 📜 Vertical scroll reading
```

#### 🎯 Key Architectural Patterns

**📱 Navigation Structure**

- **Tab-based main navigation**: Read, Favorites, Search
- **Nested route groups**: `(tabs)` and `(read)` for logical organization
- **Dynamic routing**: `[collectionId]`, `[storyNumber]`, `[frameNumber]` for flexible content access

**🔗 Deep Linking & File Handling**

- **Native intent handler**: Processes `.obs` files and content URIs from external apps
- **Direct story access**: URL-based navigation to specific stories/frames
- **File import integration**: Seamless import from WhatsApp, email, and file managers

**📖 Reading Experience**

- **Multiple reading modes**: Frame-by-frame navigation vs. continuous vertical scrolling
- **Progressive loading**: Efficient content delivery for large story collections
- **Offline-first design**: All content accessible without internet connection

**🗂️ Content Organization**

- **Language-based browsing**: Organized by language families and regions
- **Collection management**: Download, organize, and manage story collections
- **User data persistence**: Favorites, notes, and reading progress stored locally

### 🚀 Build & Deploy (EAS)

This project uses **EAS (Expo Application Services)** for professional-grade builds and deployments:

#### **Automatic Builds** 🤖 (Free Plan Optimized)

- **`main` branch** → Production builds (store-ready releases only)
- **All other builds** → Manual trigger only (conserves build minutes)

#### **Manual Builds** 🔧

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login with unfoldingword account
eas login

# Build for testing
eas build --platform all --profile preview

# Build for production
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

#### **Build Profiles**

- **`development`** - Development client with hot reload
- **`preview`** - Internal testing (APK for Android)
- **`production`** - Store-ready builds (AAB for Google Play)
